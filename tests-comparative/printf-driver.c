BOOK THE FIRST\n \
\n \
The Creation of the World \n \
\n \
Of bodies chang'd to various forms, I sing: \n \
Ye Gods, from whom these miracles did spring, \n \
Inspire my numbers with coelestial heat; \n \
'Till I my long laborious work compleat: \n \
And add perpetual tenour to my rhimes, \n \
Deduc'd from Nature's birth, to Caesar's times. \n \
Before the seas, and this terrestrial ball, \n \
And Heav'n's high canopy, that covers all, \n \
One was the face of Nature; if a face: \n \
Rather a rude and indigested mass: \n \
A lifeless lump, unfashion'd, and unfram'd, \n \
Of jarring seeds; and justly Chaos nam'd. \n \
No sun was lighted up, the world to view; \n \
No moon did yet her blunted horns renew: \n \
Nor yet was Earth suspended in the sky, \n \
Nor pois'd, did on her own foundations lye: \n \
Nor seas about the shores their arms had thrown; \n \
But earth, and air, and water, were in one. \n \
Thus air was void of light, and earth unstable, \n \
And water's dark abyss unnavigable. \n \
No certain form on any was imprest; \n \
All were confus'd, and each disturb'd the rest. \n \
For hot and cold were in one body fixt; \n \
And soft with hard, and light with heavy mixt. \n \
\n \
But God, or Nature, while they thus contend, \n \
To these intestine discords put an end: \n \
Then earth from air, and seas from earth were driv'n, \n \
And grosser air sunk from aetherial Heav'n. \n \
Thus disembroil'd, they take their proper place; \n \
The next of kin, contiguously embrace; \n \
And foes are sunder'd, by a larger space. \n \
The force of fire ascended first on high, \n \
And took its dwelling in the vaulted sky: \n \
Then air succeeds, in lightness next to fire; \n \
Whose atoms from unactive earth retire. \n \
Earth sinks beneath, and draws a num'rous throng \n \
Of pondrous, thick, unwieldy seeds along. \n \
About her coasts, unruly waters roar; \n \
And rising, on a ridge, insult the shore. \n \
Thus when the God, whatever God was he, \n \
Had form'd the whole, and made the parts agree, \n \
That no unequal portions might be found, \n \
He moulded Earth into a spacious round: \n \
Then with a breath, he gave the winds to blow; \n \
And bad the congregated waters flow. \n \
He adds the running springs, and standing lakes; \n \
And bounding banks for winding rivers makes. \n \
Some part, in Earth are swallow'd up, the most \n \
In ample oceans, disembogu'd, are lost. \n \
He shades the woods, the vallies he restrains \n \
With rocky mountains, and extends the plains. \n \
\n \
And as five zones th' aetherial regions bind, \n \
Five, correspondent, are to Earth assign'd: \n \
The sun with rays, directly darting down, \n \
Fires all beneath, and fries the middle zone: \n \
The two beneath the distant poles, complain \n \
Of endless winter, and perpetual rain. \n \
Betwixt th' extreams, two happier climates hold \n \
The temper that partakes of hot, and cold. \n \
The fields of liquid air, inclosing all, \n \
Surround the compass of this earthly ball: \n \
The lighter parts lye next the fires above; \n \
The grosser near the watry surface move: \n \
Thick clouds are spread, and storms engender there, \n \
And thunder's voice, which wretched mortals fear, \n \
And winds that on their wings cold winter bear. \n \
Nor were those blustring brethren left at large, \n \
On seas, and shores, their fury to discharge: \n \
Bound as they are, and circumscrib'd in place, \n \
They rend the world, resistless, where they pass; \n \
And mighty marks of mischief leave behind; \n \
Such is the rage of their tempestuous kind. \n \
First Eurus to the rising morn is sent \n \
(The regions of the balmy continent); \n \
And Eastern realms, where early Persians run, \n \
To greet the blest appearance of the sun. \n \
Westward, the wanton Zephyr wings his flight; \n \
Pleas'd with the remnants of departing light: \n \
Fierce Boreas, with his off-spring, issues forth \n \
T' invade the frozen waggon of the North. \n \
While frowning Auster seeks the Southern sphere; \n \
And rots, with endless rain, th' unwholsom year. \n \
\n \
High o'er the clouds, and empty realms of wind, \n \
The God a clearer space for Heav'n design'd; \n \
Where fields of light, and liquid aether flow; \n \
Purg'd from the pondrous dregs of Earth below. \n \
\n \
Scarce had the Pow'r distinguish'd these, when streight \n \
The stars, no longer overlaid with weight, \n \
Exert their heads, from underneath the mass; \n \
And upward shoot, and kindle as they pass, \n \
And with diffusive light adorn their heav'nly place. \n \
Then, every void of Nature to supply, \n \
With forms of Gods he fills the vacant sky: \n \
New herds of beasts he sends, the plains to share: \n \
New colonies of birds, to people air: \n \
And to their oozy beds, the finny fish repair. \n \
\n \
A creature of a more exalted kind \n \
Was wanting yet, and then was Man design'd: \n \
Conscious of thought, of more capacious breast, \n \
For empire form'd, and fit to rule the rest: \n \
Whether with particles of heav'nly fire \n \
The God of Nature did his soul inspire, \n \
Or Earth, but new divided from the sky, \n \
And, pliant, still retain'd th' aetherial energy: \n \
Which wise Prometheus temper'd into paste, \n \
And, mixt with living streams, the godlike image cast. \n \
\n \
Thus, while the mute creation downward bend \n \
Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend, \n \
Man looks aloft; and with erected eyes \n \
Beholds his own hereditary skies. \n \
From such rude principles our form began; \n \
And earth was metamorphos'd into Man. \n \
\n \
The Golden Age \n \
\n \
The golden age was first; when Man yet new, \n \
No rule but uncorrupted reason knew: \n \
And, with a native bent, did good pursue. \n \
Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear, \n \
His words were simple, and his soul sincere; \n \
Needless was written law, where none opprest: \n \
The law of Man was written in his breast: \n \
No suppliant crowds before the judge appear'd, \n \
No court erected yet, nor cause was heard: \n \
But all was safe, for conscience was their guard. \n \
The mountain-trees in distant prospect please, \n \
E're yet the pine descended to the seas: \n \
E're sails were spread, new oceans to explore: \n \
And happy mortals, unconcern'd for more, \n \
Confin'd their wishes to their native shore. \n \
No walls were yet; nor fence, nor mote, nor mound, \n \
Nor drum was heard, nor trumpet's angry sound: \n \
Nor swords were forg'd; but void of care and crime, \n \
The soft creation slept away their time. \n \
The teeming Earth, yet guiltless of the plough, \n \
And unprovok'd, did fruitful stores allow: \n \
Content with food, which Nature freely bred, \n \
On wildings and on strawberries they fed; \n \
Cornels and bramble-berries gave the rest, \n \
And falling acorns furnish'd out a feast. \n \
The flow'rs unsown, in fields and meadows reign'd: \n \
And Western winds immortal spring maintain'd. \n \
In following years, the bearded corn ensu'd \n \
From Earth unask'd, nor was that Earth renew'd. \n \
From veins of vallies, milk and nectar broke; \n \
And honey sweating through the pores of oak. \n \
\n \
The Silver Age \n \
\n \
But when good Saturn, banish'd from above, \n \
Was driv'n to Hell, the world was under Jove. \n \
Succeeding times a silver age behold, \n \
Excelling brass, but more excell'd by gold. \n \
Then summer, autumn, winter did appear: \n \
And spring was but a season of the year. \n \
The sun his annual course obliquely made, \n \
Good days contracted, and enlarg'd the bad. \n \
Then air with sultry heats began to glow; \n \
The wings of winds were clogg'd with ice and snow; \n \
And shivering mortals, into houses driv'n, \n \
Sought shelter from th' inclemency of Heav'n. \n \
Those houses, then, were caves, or homely sheds; \n \
With twining oziers fenc'd; and moss their beds. \n \
Then ploughs, for seed, the fruitful furrows broke, \n \
And oxen labour'd first beneath the yoke. \n \
\n \
The Brazen Age \n \
\n \
To this came next in course, the brazen age: \n \
A warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage, \n \
Not impious yet... \n \
\n \
The Iron Age \n \
\n \
Hard steel succeeded then: \n \
And stubborn as the metal, were the men. \n \
Truth, modesty, and shame, the world forsook: \n \
Fraud, avarice, and force, their places took. \n \
Then sails were spread, to every wind that blew. \n \
Raw were the sailors, and the depths were new: \n \
Trees, rudely hollow'd, did the waves sustain; \n \
E're ships in triumph plough'd the watry plain. \n \
\n \
Then land-marks limited to each his right: \n \
For all before was common as the light. \n \
Nor was the ground alone requir'd to bear \n \
Her annual income to the crooked share, \n \
But greedy mortals, rummaging her store, \n \
Digg'd from her entrails first the precious oar; \n \
Which next to Hell, the prudent Gods had laid; \n \
And that alluring ill, to sight display'd. \n \
Thus cursed steel, and more accursed gold, \n \
Gave mischief birth, and made that mischief bold: \n \
And double death did wretched Man invade, \n \
By steel assaulted, and by gold betray'd, \n \
Now (brandish'd weapons glittering in their hands) \n \
Mankind is broken loose from moral bands; \n \
No rights of hospitality remain: \n \
The guest, by him who harbour'd him, is slain, \n \
The son-in-law pursues the father's life; \n \
The wife her husband murders, he the wife. \n \
The step-dame poyson for the son prepares; \n \
The son inquires into his father's years. \n \
Faith flies, and piety in exile mourns; \n \
And justice, here opprest, to Heav'n returns. \n \
\n \
The Giants' War \n \
\n \
Nor were the Gods themselves more safe above; \n \
Against beleaguer'd Heav'n the giants move. \n \
Hills pil'd on hills, on mountains mountains lie, \n \
To make their mad approaches to the skie. \n \
'Till Jove, no longer patient, took his time \n \
T' avenge with thunder their audacious crime: \n \
Red light'ning plaid along the firmament, \n \
And their demolish'd works to pieces rent. \n \
Sing'd with the flames, and with the bolts transfixt, \n \
With native Earth, their blood the monsters mixt; \n \
The blood, indu'd with animating heat, \n \
Did in th' impregnant Earth new sons beget: \n \
They, like the seed from which they sprung, accurst, \n \
Against the Gods immortal hatred nurst, \n \
An impious, arrogant, and cruel brood; \n \
Expressing their original from blood. \n \
\n \
Which when the king of Gods beheld from high \n \
(Withal revolving in his memory, \n \
What he himself had found on Earth of late, \n \
Lycaon's guilt, and his inhumane treat), \n \
He sigh'd; nor longer with his pity strove; \n \
But kindled to a wrath becoming Jove: \n \
\n \
Then call'd a general council of the Gods; \n \
Who summon'd, issue from their blest abodes, \n \
And fill th' assembly with a shining train. \n \
A way there is, in Heav'n's expanded plain, \n \
Which, when the skies are clear, is seen below, \n \
And mortals, by the name of Milky, know. \n \
The ground-work is of stars; through which the road \n \
Lyes open to the Thunderer's abode: \n \
The Gods of greater nations dwell around, \n \
And, on the right and left, the palace bound; \n \
The commons where they can: the nobler sort \n \
With winding-doors wide open, front the court. \n \
This place, as far as Earth with Heav'n may vie, \n \
I dare to call the Louvre of the skie. \n \
When all were plac'd, in seats distinctly known, \n \
And he, their father, had assum'd the throne, \n \
Upon his iv'ry sceptre first he leant, \n \
Then shook his head, that shook the firmament: \n \
Air, Earth, and seas, obey'd th' almighty nod; \n \
And, with a gen'ral fear, confess'd the God. \n \
At length, with indignation, thus he broke \n \
His awful silence, and the Pow'rs bespoke. \n \
\n \
I was not more concern'd in that debate \n \
Of empire, when our universal state \n \
Was put to hazard, and the giant race \n \
Our captive skies were ready to imbrace: \n \
For tho' the foe was fierce, the seeds of all \n \
Rebellion, sprung from one original; \n \
Now, wheresoever ambient waters glide, \n \
All are corrupt, and all must be destroy'd. \n \
Let me this holy protestation make, \n \
By Hell, and Hell's inviolable lake, \n \
I try'd whatever in the godhead lay: \n \
But gangren'd members must be lopt away, \n \
Before the nobler parts are tainted to decay. \n \
There dwells below, a race of demi-gods, \n \
Of nymphs in waters, and of fawns in woods: \n \
Who, tho' not worthy yet, in Heav'n to live, \n \
Let 'em, at least, enjoy that Earth we give. \n \
Can these be thought securely lodg'd below, \n \
When I my self, who no superior know, \n \
I, who have Heav'n and Earth at my command, \n \
Have been attempted by Lycaon's hand? \n \
\n \
At this a murmur through the synod went, \n \
And with one voice they vote his punishment. \n \
Thus, when conspiring traytors dar'd to doom \n \
The fall of Caesar, and in him of Rome, \n \
The nations trembled with a pious fear; \n \
All anxious for their earthly Thunderer: \n \
Nor was their care, o Caesar, less esteem'd \n \
By thee, than that of Heav'n for Jove was deem'd: \n \
Who with his hand, and voice, did first restrain \n \
Their murmurs, then resum'd his speech again. \n \
The Gods to silence were compos'd, and sate \n \
With reverence, due to his superior state. \n \
\n \
Cancel your pious cares; already he \n \
Has paid his debt to justice, and to me. \n \
Yet what his crimes, and what my judgments were, \n \
Remains for me thus briefly to declare. \n \
The clamours of this vile degenerate age, \n \
The cries of orphans, and th' oppressor's rage, \n \
Had reach'd the stars: I will descend, said I, \n \
In hope to prove this loud complaint a lye. \n \
Disguis'd in humane shape, I travell'd round \n \
The world, and more than what I heard, I found. \n \
O'er Maenalus I took my steepy way, \n \
By caverns infamous for beasts of prey: \n \
Then cross'd Cyllene, and the piny shade \n \
More infamous, by curst Lycaon made: \n \
Dark night had cover'd Heaven, and Earth, before \n \
I enter'd his unhospitable door. \n \
Just at my entrance, I display'd the sign \n \
That somewhat was approaching of divine. \n \
The prostrate people pray; the tyrant grins; \n \
And, adding prophanation to his sins, \n \
I'll try, said he, and if a God appear, \n \
To prove his deity shall cost him dear. \n \
'Twas late; the graceless wretch my death prepares, \n \
When I shou'd soundly sleep, opprest with cares: \n \
This dire experiment he chose, to prove \n \
If I were mortal, or undoubted Jove: \n \
But first he had resolv'd to taste my pow'r; \n \
Not long before, but in a luckless hour, \n \
Some legates, sent from the Molossian state, \n \
Were on a peaceful errand come to treat: \n \
Of these he murders one, he boils the flesh; \n \
And lays the mangled morsels in a dish: \n \
Some part he roasts; then serves it up, so drest, \n \
And bids me welcome to this humane feast. \n \
Mov'd with disdain, the table I o'er-turn'd; \n \
And with avenging flames, the palace burn'd. \n \
The tyrant in a fright, for shelter gains \n \
The neighb'ring fields, and scours along the plains. \n \
Howling he fled, and fain he wou'd have spoke; \n \
But humane voice his brutal tongue forsook. \n \
About his lips the gather'd foam he churns, \n \
And, breathing slaughters, still with rage he burns, \n \
But on the bleating flock his fury turns. \n \
His mantle, now his hide, with rugged hairs \n \
Cleaves to his back; a famish'd face he bears; \n \
His arms descend, his shoulders sink away \n \
To multiply his legs for chase of prey. \n \
He grows a wolf, his hoariness remains, \n \
And the same rage in other members reigns. \n \
His eyes still sparkle in a narr'wer space: \n \
His jaws retain the grin, and violence of his face \n \
\n \
This was a single ruin, but not one \n \
Deserves so just a punishment alone. \n \
Mankind's a monster, and th' ungodly times \n \
Confed'rate into guilt, are sworn to crimes. \n \
All are alike involv'd in ill, and all \n \
Must by the same relentless fury fall. \n \
Thus ended he; the greater Gods assent; \n \
By clamours urging his severe intent; \n \
The less fill up the cry for punishment. \n \
Yet still with pity they remember Man; \n \
And mourn as much as heav'nly spirits can. \n \
They ask, when those were lost of humane birth, \n \
What he wou'd do with all this waste of Earth: \n \
If his dispeopl'd world he would resign \n \
To beasts, a mute, and more ignoble line; \n \
Neglected altars must no longer smoke, \n \
If none were left to worship, and invoke. \n \
To whom the Father of the Gods reply'd, \n \
Lay that unnecessary fear aside: \n \
Mine be the care, new people to provide. \n \
I will from wondrous principles ordain \n \
A race unlike the first, and try my skill again. \n \
\n \
Already had he toss'd the flaming brand; \n \
And roll'd the thunder in his spacious hand; \n \
Preparing to discharge on seas and land: \n \
But stopt, for fear, thus violently driv'n, \n \
The sparks should catch his axle-tree of Heav'n. \n \
Remembring in the fates, a time when fire \n \
Shou'd to the battlements of Heaven aspire, \n \
And all his blazing worlds above shou'd burn; \n \
And all th' inferior globe to cinders turn. \n \
His dire artill'ry thus dismist, he bent \n \
His thoughts to some securer punishment: \n \
Concludes to pour a watry deluge down; \n \
And what he durst not burn, resolves to drown. \n \
\n \
The northern breath, that freezes floods, he binds; \n \
With all the race of cloud-dispelling winds: \n \
The south he loos'd, who night and horror brings; \n \
And foggs are shaken from his flaggy wings. \n \
From his divided beard two streams he pours, \n \
His head, and rheumy eyes distill in show'rs, \n \
With rain his robe, and heavy mantle flow: \n \
And lazy mists are lowring on his brow; \n \
Still as he swept along, with his clench'd fist \n \
He squeez'd the clouds, th' imprison'd clouds resist: \n \
The skies, from pole to pole, with peals resound; \n \
And show'rs inlarg'd, come pouring on the ground. \n \
Then, clad in colours of a various dye, \n \
Junonian Iris breeds a new supply \n \
To feed the clouds: impetuous rain descends; \n \
The bearded corn beneath the burden bends: \n \
Defrauded clowns deplore their perish'd grain; \n \
And the long labours of the year are vain. \n \
\n \
Nor from his patrimonial Heaven alone \n \
Is Jove content to pour his vengeance down; \n \
Aid from his brother of the seas he craves, \n \
To help him with auxiliary waves. \n \
The watry tyrant calls his brooks and floods, \n \
Who rowl from mossie caves (their moist abodes); \n \
And with perpetual urns his palace fill: \n \
To whom in brief, he thus imparts his will. \n \
\n \
Small exhortation needs; your pow'rs employ: \n \
And this bad world, so Jove requires, destroy. \n \
Let loose the reins to all your watry store: \n \
Bear down the damms, and open ev'ry door. \n \
\n \
The floods, by Nature enemies to land, \n \
And proudly swelling with their new command, \n \
Remove the living stones, that stopt their way, \n \
And gushing from their source, augment the sea. \n \
Then, with his mace, their monarch struck the ground; \n \
With inward trembling Earth receiv'd the wound; \n \
And rising streams a ready passage found. \n \
Th' expanded waters gather on the plain: \n \
They float the fields, and over-top the grain; \n \
Then rushing onwards, with a sweepy sway, \n \
Bear flocks, and folds, and lab'ring hinds away. \n \
Nor safe their dwellings were, for, sap'd by floods, \n \
Their houses fell upon their houshold Gods. \n \
The solid piles, too strongly built to fall, \n \
High o'er their heads, behold a watry wall: \n \
Now seas and Earth were in confusion lost; \n \
A world of waters, and without a coast. \n \
\n \
One climbs a cliff; one in his boat is born: \n \
And ploughs above, where late he sow'd his corn. \n \
Others o'er chimney-tops and turrets row, \n \
And drop their anchors on the meads below: \n \
Or downward driv'n, they bruise the tender vine, \n \
Or tost aloft, are knock'd against a pine. \n \
And where of late the kids had cropt the grass, \n \
The monsters of the deep now take their place. \n \
Insulting Nereids on the cities ride, \n \
And wond'ring dolphins o'er the palace glide. \n \
On leaves, and masts of mighty oaks they brouze; \n \
And their broad fins entangle in the boughs. \n \
The frighted wolf now swims amongst the sheep; \n \
The yellow lion wanders in the deep: \n \
His rapid force no longer helps the boar: \n \
The stag swims faster, than he ran before. \n \
The fowls, long beating on their wings in vain, \n \
Despair of land, and drop into the main. \n \
Now hills, and vales no more distinction know; \n \
And levell'd Nature lies oppress'd below. \n \
The most of mortals perish in the flood: \n \
The small remainder dies for want of food. \n \
\n \
A mountain of stupendous height there stands \n \
Betwixt th' Athenian and Boeotian lands, \n \
The bound of fruitful fields, while fields they were, \n \
But then a field of waters did appear: \n \
Parnassus is its name; whose forky rise \n \
Mounts thro' the clouds, and mates the lofty skies. \n \
High on the summit of this dubious cliff, \n \
Deucalion wafting, moor'd his little skiff. \n \
He with his wife were only left behind \n \
Of perish'd Man; they two were human kind. \n \
The mountain nymphs, and Themis they adore, \n \
And from her oracles relief implore. \n \
The most upright of mortal men was he; \n \
The most sincere, and holy woman, she. \n \
\n \
When Jupiter, surveying Earth from high, \n \
Beheld it in a lake of water lie, \n \
That where so many millions lately liv'd, \n \
But two, the best of either sex, surviv'd; \n \
He loos'd the northern wind; fierce Boreas flies \n \
To puff away the clouds, and purge the skies: \n \
Serenely, while he blows, the vapours driv'n, \n \
Discover Heav'n to Earth, and Earth to Heav'n. \n \
The billows fall, while Neptune lays his mace \n \
On the rough sea, and smooths its furrow'd face. \n \
Already Triton, at his call, appears \n \
Above the waves; a Tyrian robe he wears; \n \
And in his hand a crooked trumpet bears. \n \
The soveraign bids him peaceful sounds inspire, \n \
And give the waves the signal to retire. \n \
His writhen shell he takes; whose narrow vent \n \
Grows by degrees into a large extent, \n \
Then gives it breath; the blast with doubling sound, \n \
Runs the wide circuit of the world around: \n \
The sun first heard it, in his early east, \n \
And met the rattling ecchos in the west. \n \
The waters, listning to the trumpet's roar, \n \
Obey the summons, and forsake the shore. \n \
\n \
A thin circumference of land appears; \n \
And Earth, but not at once, her visage rears, \n \
And peeps upon the seas from upper grounds; \n \
The streams, but just contain'd within their bounds, \n \
By slow degrees into their channels crawl; \n \
And Earth increases, as the waters fall. \n \
In longer time the tops of trees appear, \n \
Which mud on their dishonour'd branches bear. \n \
\n \
At length the world was all restor'd to view; \n \
But desolate, and of a sickly hue: \n \
Nature beheld her self, and stood aghast, \n \
A dismal desart, and a silent waste. \n \
\n \
Which when Deucalion, with a piteous look \n \
Beheld, he wept, and thus to Pyrrha spoke: \n \
Oh wife, oh sister, oh of all thy kind \n \
The best, and only creature left behind, \n \
By kindred, love, and now by dangers joyn'd; \n \
Of multitudes, who breath'd the common air, \n \
We two remain; a species in a pair: \n \
The rest the seas have swallow'd; nor have we \n \
Ev'n of this wretched life a certainty. \n \
The clouds are still above; and, while I speak, \n \
A second deluge o'er our heads may break. \n \
Shou'd I be snatcht from hence, and thou remain, \n \
Without relief, or partner of thy pain, \n \
How cou'dst thou such a wretched life sustain? \n \
Shou'd I be left, and thou be lost, the sea \n \
That bury'd her I lov'd, shou'd bury me. \n \
Oh cou'd our father his old arts inspire, \n \
And make me heir of his informing fire, \n \
That so I might abolisht Man retrieve, \n \
And perisht people in new souls might live. \n \
But Heav'n is pleas'd, nor ought we to complain, \n \
That we, th' examples of mankind, remain. \n \
He said; the careful couple joyn their tears: \n \
And then invoke the Gods, with pious prayers. \n \
Thus, in devotion having eas'd their grief, \n \
From sacred oracles they seek relief; \n \
And to Cephysus' brook their way pursue: \n \
The stream was troubled, but the ford they knew; \n \
With living waters, in the fountain bred, \n \
They sprinkle first their garments, and their head, \n \
Then took the way, which to the temple led. \n \
The roofs were all defil'd with moss, and mire, \n \
The desart altars void of solemn fire. \n \
Before the gradual, prostrate they ador'd; \n \
The pavement kiss'd; and thus the saint implor'd. \n \
\n \
O righteous Themis, if the Pow'rs above \n \
By pray'rs are bent to pity, and to love; \n \
If humane miseries can move their mind; \n \
If yet they can forgive, and yet be kind; \n \
Tell how we may restore, by second birth, \n \
Mankind, and people desolated Earth. \n \
Then thus the gracious Goddess, nodding, said; \n \
Depart, and with your vestments veil your head: \n \
And stooping lowly down, with losen'd zones, \n \
Throw each behind your backs, your mighty mother's bones.\n \
\n \
Amaz'd the pair, and mute with wonder stand, \n \
'Till Pyrrha first refus'd the dire command. \n \
Forbid it Heav'n, said she, that I shou'd tear \n \
Those holy reliques from the sepulcher. \n \
They ponder'd the mysterious words again, \n \
For some new sense; and long they sought in vain: \n \
At length Deucalion clear'd his cloudy brow, \n \
And said, the dark Aenigma will allow \n \
A meaning, which, if well I understand, \n \
From sacrilege will free the God's command: \n \
This Earth our mighty mother is, the stones \n \
In her capacious body, are her bones: \n \
These we must cast behind. With hope, and fear, \n \
The woman did the new solution hear: \n \
The man diffides in his own augury, \n \
And doubts the Gods; yet both resolve to try. \n \
Descending from the mount, they first unbind \n \
Their vests, and veil'd, they cast the stones behind: \n \
The stones (a miracle to mortal view, \n \
But long tradition makes it pass for true) \n \
Did first the rigour of their kind expel, \n \
And suppled into softness, as they fell; \n \
Then swell'd, and swelling, by degrees grew warm; \n \
And took the rudiments of human form. \n \
Imperfect shapes: in marble such are seen, \n \
When the rude chizzel does the man begin; \n \
While yet the roughness of the stone remains, \n \
Without the rising muscles, and the veins. \n \
The sappy parts, and next resembling juice, \n \
Were turn'd to moisture, for the body's use: \n \
Supplying humours, blood, and nourishment; \n \
The rest, too solid to receive a bent, \n \
Converts to bones; and what was once a vein, \n \
Its former name and Nature did retain. \n \
By help of pow'r divine, in little space, \n \
What the man threw, assum'd a manly face; \n \
And what the wife, renew'd the female race. \n \
Hence we derive our nature; born to bear \n \
Laborious life; and harden'd into care. \n \
\n \
The rest of animals, from teeming Earth \n \
Produc'd, in various forms receiv'd their birth. \n \
The native moisture, in its close retreat, \n \
Digested by the sun's aetherial heat, \n \
As in a kindly womb, began to breed: \n \
Then swell'd, and quicken'd by the vital seed. \n \
And some in less, and some in longer space, \n \
Were ripen'd into form, and took a sev'ral face. \n \
Thus when the Nile from Pharian fields is fled, \n \
And seeks, with ebbing tides, his ancient bed, \n \
The fat manure with heav'nly fire is warm'd; \n \
And crusted creatures, as in wombs, are form'd; \n \
These, when they turn the glebe, the peasants find; \n \
Some rude, and yet unfinish'd in their kind: \n \
Short of their limbs, a lame imperfect birth: \n \
One half alive; and one of lifeless earth. \n \
\n \
For heat, and moisture, when in bodies join'd, \n \
The temper that results from either kind \n \
Conception makes; and fighting 'till they mix, \n \
Their mingled atoms in each other fix. \n \
Thus Nature's hand the genial bed prepares \n \
With friendly discord, and with fruitful wars. \n \
\n \
From hence the surface of the ground, with mud \n \
And slime besmear'd (the faeces of the flood), \n \
Receiv'd the rays of Heav'n: and sucking in \n \
The seeds of heat, new creatures did begin: \n \
Some were of sev'ral sorts produc'd before, \n \
But of new monsters, Earth created more. \n \
Unwillingly, but yet she brought to light \n \
Thee, Python too, the wondring world to fright, \n \
And the new nations, with so dire a sight: \n \
So monstrous was his bulk, so large a space \n \
Did his vast body, and long train embrace. \n \
Whom Phoebus basking on a bank espy'd; \n \
E're now the God his arrows had not try'd \n \
But on the trembling deer, or mountain goat; \n \
At this new quarry he prepares to shoot. \n \
Though ev'ry shaft took place, he spent the store \n \
Of his full quiver; and 'twas long before \n \
Th' expiring serpent wallow'd in his gore. \n \
Then, to preserve the fame of such a deed, \n \
For Python slain, he Pythian games decred. \n \
Where noble youths for mastership shou'd strive, \n \
To quoit, to run, and steeds, and chariots drive. \n \
The prize was fame: in witness of renown \n \
An oaken garland did the victor crown. \n \
The laurel was not yet for triumphs born; \n \
But every green alike by Phoebus worn, \n \
Did, with promiscuous grace, his flowing locks adorn. \n \
\n \
The Transformation of Daphne into a Lawrel \n \
\n \
The first and fairest of his loves, was she \n \
Whom not blind fortune, but the dire decree \n \
Of angry Cupid forc'd him to desire: \n \
Daphne her name, and Peneus was her sire. \n \
Swell'd with the pride, that new success attends, \n \
He sees the stripling, while his bow he bends, \n \
And thus insults him: Thou lascivious boy, \n \
Are arms like these for children to employ? \n \
Know, such atchievements are my proper claim; \n \
Due to my vigour, and unerring aim: \n \
Resistless are my shafts, and Python late \n \
In such a feather'd death, has found his fate. \n \
Take up the torch (and lay my weapons by), \n \
With that the feeble souls of lovers fry. \n \
To whom the son of Venus thus reply'd, \n \
Phoebus, thy shafts are sure on all beside, \n \
But mine of Phoebus, mine the fame shall be \n \
Of all thy conquests, when I conquer thee. \n \
\n \
He said, and soaring, swiftly wing'd his flight: \n \
Nor stopt but on Parnassus' airy height. \n \
Two diff'rent shafts he from his quiver draws; \n \
One to repel desire, and one to cause. \n \
One shaft is pointed with refulgent gold: \n \
To bribe the love, and make the lover bold: \n \
One blunt, and tipt with lead, whose base allay \n \
Provokes disdain, and drives desire away. \n \
The blunted bolt against the nymph he drest: \n \
But with the sharp transfixt Apollo's breast. \n \
\n \
Th' enamour'd deity pursues the chace; \n \
The scornful damsel shuns his loath'd embrace: \n \
In hunting beasts of prey, her youth employs; \n \
And Phoebe rivals in her rural joys. \n \
With naked neck she goes, and shoulders bare; \n \
And with a fillet binds her flowing hair. \n \
By many suitors sought, she mocks their pains, \n \
And still her vow'd virginity maintains. \n \
Impatient of a yoke, the name of bride \n \
She shuns, and hates the joys, she never try'd. \n \
On wilds, and woods, she fixes her desire: \n \
Nor knows what youth, and kindly love, inspire. \n \
Her father chides her oft: Thou ow'st, says he, \n \
A husband to thy self, a son to me. \n \
She, like a crime, abhors the nuptial bed: \n \
She glows with blushes, and she hangs her head. \n \
Then casting round his neck her tender arms, \n \
Sooths him with blandishments, and filial charms: \n \
Give me, my Lord, she said, to live, and die, \n \
A spotless maid, without the marriage tye. \n \
'Tis but a small request; I beg no more \n \
Than what Diana's father gave before. \n \
The good old sire was soften'd to consent; \n \
But said her wish wou'd prove her punishment: \n \
For so much youth, and so much beauty join'd, \n \
Oppos'd the state, which her desires design'd. \n \
\n \
The God of light, aspiring to her bed, \n \
Hopes what he seeks, with flattering fancies fed; \n \
And is, by his own oracles, mis-led. \n \
And as in empty fields the stubble burns, \n \
Or nightly travellers, when day returns, \n \
Their useless torches on dry hedges throw, \n \
That catch the flames, and kindle all the row; \n \
So burns the God, consuming in desire, \n \
And feeding in his breast a fruitless fire: \n \
Her well-turn'd neck he view'd (her neck was bare) \n \
And on her shoulders her dishevel'd hair; \n \
Oh were it comb'd, said he, with what a grace \n \
Wou'd every waving curl become her face! \n \
He view'd her eyes, like heav'nly lamps that shone, \n \
He view'd her lips, too sweet to view alone, \n \
Her taper fingers, and her panting breast; \n \
He praises all he sees, and for the rest \n \
Believes the beauties yet unseen are best: \n \
Swift as the wind, the damsel fled away, \n \
Nor did for these alluring speeches stay: \n \
Stay Nymph, he cry'd, I follow, not a foe. \n \
Thus from the lyon trips the trembling doe; \n \
Thus from the wolf the frighten'd lamb removes, \n \
And, from pursuing faulcons, fearful doves; \n \
Thou shunn'st a God, and shunn'st a God, that loves. \n \
Ah, lest some thorn shou'd pierce thy tender foot, \n \
Or thou shou'dst fall in flying my pursuit! \n \
To sharp uneven ways thy steps decline; \n \
Abate thy speed, and I will bate of mine. \n \
Yet think from whom thou dost so rashly fly; \n \
Nor basely born, nor shepherd's swain am I. \n \
Perhaps thou know'st not my superior state; \n \
And from that ignorance proceeds thy hate. \n \
Me Claros, Delphi, Tenedos obey; \n \
These hands the Patareian scepter sway. \n \
The King of Gods begot me: what shall be, \n \
Or is, or ever was, in Fate, I see. \n \
Mine is th' invention of the charming lyre; \n \
Sweet notes, and heav'nly numbers, I inspire. \n \
Sure is my bow, unerring is my dart; \n \
But ah! more deadly his, who pierc'd my heart. \n \
Med'cine is mine; what herbs and simples grow \n \
In fields, and forrests, all their pow'rs I know; \n \
And am the great physician call'd, below. \n \
Alas that fields and forrests can afford. \n \
No remedies to heal their love-sick lord! \n \
To cure the pains of love, no plant avails: \n \
And his own physick, the physician falls. \n \
\n \
She heard not half; so furiously she flies; \n \
And on her ear th' imperfect accent dies, \n \
Fear gave her wings; and as she fled, the wind \n \
Increasing, spread her flowing hair behind; \n \
And left her legs and thighs expos'd to view: \n \
Which made the God more eager to pursue. \n \
The God was young, and was too hotly bent \n \
To lose his time in empty compliment: \n \
But led by love, and fir'd with such a sight, \n \
Impetuously pursu'd his near delight. \n \
\n \
As when th' impatient greyhound slipt from far, \n \
Bounds o'er the glebe to course the fearful hare, \n \
She in her speed does all her safety lay; \n \
And he with double speed pursues the prey; \n \
O'er-runs her at the sitting turn, and licks \n \
His chaps in vain, and blows upon the flix: \n \
She scapes, and for the neighb'ring covert strives, \n \
And gaining shelter, doubts if yet she lives: \n \
If little things with great we may compare, \n \
Such was the God, and such the flying fair, \n \
She urg'd by fear, her feet did swiftly move, \n \
But he more swiftly, who was urg'd by love. \n \
He gathers ground upon her in the chace: \n \
Now breathes upon her hair, with nearer pace; \n \
And just is fast'ning on the wish'd embrace. \n \
The nymph grew pale, and in a mortal fright, \n \
Spent with the labour of so long a flight; \n \
And now despairing, cast a mournful look \n \
Upon the streams of her paternal brook; \n \
Oh help, she cry'd, in this extreamest need! \n \
If water Gods are deities indeed: \n \
Gape Earth, and this unhappy wretch intomb; \n \
Or change my form, whence all my sorrows come. \n \
Scarce had she finish'd, when her feet she found \n \
Benumb'd with cold, and fasten'd to the ground: \n \
A filmy rind about her body grows; \n \
Her hair to leaves, her arms extend to boughs: \n \
The nymph is all into a lawrel gone; \n \
The smoothness of her skin remains alone. \n \
Yet Phoebus loves her still, and casting round \n \
Her bole, his arms, some little warmth he found. \n \
The tree still panted in th' unfinish'd part: \n \
Not wholly vegetive, and heav'd her heart. \n \
He fixt his lips upon the trembling rind; \n \
It swerv'd aside, and his embrace declin'd. \n \
To whom the God, Because thou canst not be \n \
My mistress, I espouse thee for my tree: \n \
Be thou the prize of honour, and renown; \n \
The deathless poet, and the poem, crown. \n \
Thou shalt the Roman festivals adorn, \n \
And, after poets, be by victors worn. \n \
Thou shalt returning Caesar's triumph grace; \n \
When pomps shall in a long procession pass. \n \
Wreath'd on the posts before his palace wait; \n \
And be the sacred guardian of the gate. \n \
Secure from thunder, and unharm'd by Jove, \n \
Unfading as th' immortal Pow'rs above: \n \
And as the locks of Phoebus are unshorn, \n \
So shall perpetual green thy boughs adorn. \n \
The grateful tree was pleas'd with what he said; \n \
And shook the shady honours of her head. \n \
\n \
The Transformation of Io into a Heyfer \n \
\n \
An ancient forest in Thessalia grows; \n \
Which Tempe's pleasing valley does inclose: \n \
Through this the rapid Peneus take his course; \n \
From Pindus rolling with impetuous force; \n \
Mists from the river's mighty fall arise: \n \
And deadly damps inclose the cloudy skies: \n \
Perpetual fogs are hanging o'er the wood; \n \
And sounds of waters deaf the neighbourhood. \n \
Deep, in a rocky cave, he makes abode \n \
(A mansion proper for a mourning God). \n \
Here he gives audience; issuing out decrees \n \
To rivers, his dependant deities. \n \
On this occasion hither they resort; \n \
To pay their homage, and to make their court. \n \
All doubtful, whether to congratulate \n \
His daughter's honour, or lament her fate. \n \
Sperchaeus, crown'd with poplar, first appears; \n \
Then old Apidanus came crown'd with years: \n \
Enipeus turbulent, Amphrysos tame; \n \
And Aeas last with lagging waters came. \n \
Then, of his kindred brooks, a num'rous throng \n \
Condole his loss; and bring their urns along. \n \
Not one was wanting of the wat'ry train, \n \
That fill'd his flood, or mingled with the main: \n \
But Inachus, who in his cave, alone, \n \
Wept not another's losses, but his own, \n \
For his dear Io, whether stray'd, or dead, \n \
To him uncertain, doubtful tears he shed. \n \
He sought her through the world; but sought in vain; \n \
And no where finding, rather fear'd her slain. \n \
\n \
Her, just returning from her father's brook, \n \
Jove had beheld, with a desiring look: \n \
And, Oh fair daughter of the flood, he said, \n \
Worthy alone of Jove's imperial bed, \n \
Happy whoever shall those charms possess; \n \
The king of Gods (nor is thy lover less) \n \
Invites thee to yon cooler shades; to shun \n \
The scorching rays of the meridian sun. \n \
Nor shalt thou tempt the dangers of the grove  \
Alone, without a guide; thy guide is Jove.  \
No puny Pow'r, but he whose high command  \
Is unconfin'd, who rules the seas and land;  \
And tempers thunder in his awful hand,  \
Oh fly not: for she fled from his embrace  \
O'er Lerna's pastures: he pursu'd the chace  \
Along the shades of the Lyrcaean plain;  \
At length the God, who never asks in vain,  \
Involv'd with vapours, imitating night,  \
Both Air, and Earth; and then suppress'd her flight,  \
And mingling force with love, enjoy'd the full delight.  \
Mean-time the jealous Juno, from on high, \
Survey'd the fruitful fields of Arcady;  \
And wonder'd that the mist shou'd over-run  \
The face of day-light, and obscure the sun.  \
No nat'ral cause she found, from brooks, or bogs,  \
Or marshy lowlands, to produce the fogs;  \
Then round the skies she sought for Jupiter,  \
Her faithless husband; but no Jove was there:  \
Suspecting now the worst, Or I, she said,  \
Am much mistaken, or am much betray'd.  \
With fury she precipitates her flight:  \
Dispels the shadows of dissembled night;  \
And to the day restores his native light.  \
Th' Almighty Leacher, careful to prevent  \
The consequence, foreseeing her descent,  \
Transforms his mistress in a trice; and now  \
In Io's place appears a lovely cow.  \
So sleek her skin, so faultless was her make,  \
Ev'n Juno did unwilling pleasure take  \
To see so fair a rival of her love;  \
And what she was, and whence, enquir'd of Jove:  \
Of what fair herd, and from what pedigree?  \
The God, half caught, was forc'd upon a lye:  \
And said she sprung from Earth. She took the word,  \
And begg'd the beauteous heyfer of her lord.  \
What should he do? 'twas equal shame to Jove  \
Or to relinquish, or betray his love:  \
Yet to refuse so slight a gift, wou'd be \
But more t' increase his consort's jealousie:  \
Thus fear, and love, by turns, his heart assail'd;  \
And stronger love had sure, at length, prevail'd:  \
But some faint hope remain'd, his jealous queen  \
Had not the mistress through the heyfer seen.  \
The cautious Goddess, of her gift possest,  \
Yet harbour'd anxious thoughts within her breast;  \
As she who knew the falshood of her Jove;  \
And justly fear'd some new relapse of love.  \
Which to prevent, and to secure her care,  \
To trusty Argus she commits the fair.  \
 \
The head of Argus (as with stars the skies)  \
Was compass'd round, and wore an hundred eyes.  \
But two by turns their lids in slumber steep;  \
The rest on duty still their station keep;  \
Nor cou'd the total constellation sleep.  \
Thus, ever present, to his eyes, and mind,  \
His charge was still before him, tho' behind.  \
In fields he suffer'd her to feed by Day,  \
But when the setting sun to night gave way,  \
The captive cow he summon'd with a call; \
And drove her back, and ty'd her to the stall.  \
On leaves of trees, and bitter herbs she fed,  \
Heav'n was her canopy, bare earth her bed:  \
So hardly lodg'd, and to digest her food,  \
She drank from troubled streams, defil'd with mud.  \
Her woeful story fain she wou'd have told,  \
With hands upheld, but had no hands to hold.  \
Her head to her ungentle keeper bow'd,  \
She strove to speak, she spoke not, but she low'd:  \
Affrighted with the noise, she look'd around,  \
And seem'd t' inquire the author of the sound.  \
 \
Once on the banks where often she had play'd  \
(Her father's banks), she came, and there survey'd  \
Her alter'd visage, and her branching head;  \
And starting, from her self she wou'd have fled.  \
Her fellow nymphs, familiar to her eyes,  \
Beheld, but knew her not in this disguise.  \
Ev'n Inachus himself was ignorant;  \
And in his daughter, did his daughter want.  \
She follow'd where her fellows went, as she  \
Were still a partner of the company:  \
They stroak her neck; the gentle heyfer stands,  \
And her neck offers to their stroaking hands.  \
Her father gave her grass; the grass she took;  \
And lick'd his palms, and cast a piteous look;  \
And in the language of her eyes, she spoke.  \
She wou'd have told her name, and ask'd relief,  \
But wanting words, in tears she tells her grief.  \
Which, with her foot she makes him understand;  \
And prints the name of Io in the sand.  \
 \
Ah wretched me! her mournful father cry'd;  \
She, with a sigh, to wretched me reply'd:  \
About her milk-white neck, his arms he threw;  \
And wept, and then these tender words ensue.  \
And art thou she, whom I have sought around  \
The world, and have at length so sadly found? \
So found, is worse than lost: with mutual words  \
Thou answer'st not, no voice thy tongue affords:  \
But sighs are deeply drawn from out thy breast;  \
And speech deny'd, by lowing is express'd.  \
Unknowing, I prepar'd thy bridal bed;  \
With empty hopes of happy issue fed.  \
But now the husband of a herd must be  \
Thy mate, and bell'wing sons thy progeny.  \
Oh, were I mortal, death might bring relief:  \
But now my God-head but extends my grief:  \
Prolongs my woes, of which no end I see,  \
And makes me curse my immortality!  \
More had he said, but fearful of her stay,  \
The starry guardian drove his charge away,  \
To some fresh pasture; on a hilly height  \
He sate himself, and kept her still in sight.  \
 \
The Eyes of Argus transform'd into a Peacock's Train  \
 \
Now Jove no longer cou'd her suff'rings bear;  \
But call'd in haste his airy messenger,  ";
