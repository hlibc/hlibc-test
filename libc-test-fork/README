libc-testsuite README


This package is a collection of unit tests to measure the correctness
and robustness of a C/POSIX standard library implementation. It was
developed as a tool for testing musl and its first-generation
predecessor. As such, most of the tests were written to be
self-contained and not to make assumptions about other library
interfaces being present or working correctly.

At present the whole testsuite builds as a single binary and runs as a
single process (aside from a few child processes that are part of the
tests). This makes it extremely fast, but also means that corruption
of the global state due to bugs in one set of interfaces may affect
later tests. If necessary, the main test dispatch module could be
modified to fork before running each test, ensuring that each one
begins with a clean working state.


Building and running the tests

If needed, a file named config.mak can be created to override the
default CC, CFLAGS, etc. used by the build process. Otherwise, simply
run "make" in the libc-testsuite directory to build the tests. Then
run "./testsuite" or "make test" to run the tests.

The following additional CFLAGS options may be of interest:

-DHAVE_BSD_STRL - tests the BSD strlcpy and strlcat functions.
-DDISABLE_SLOW_TESTS - disables testing 2GB snprintf.
